<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About NC News

NC News is a platform, featuring articles written by Northcoders staff and students. The app allows users to view lists of articles by topics, vote on articles and add comments. The API used by the app spins down when there has been a period of inactivity - please allow up to one minute for the app to load when first accessing it.

Planned updates include allowing users to be able to add their own articles to the site, delete their previously added articles, view lists of articles written by each user, voting on comments, the ability to edit comments that a user previously posted themselves and adding a count of articles for each topic or user.
